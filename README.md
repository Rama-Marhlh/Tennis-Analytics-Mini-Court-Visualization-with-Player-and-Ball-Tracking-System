# Tennis-Analytics-Mini-Court-Visualization-with-Player-and-Ball-Tracking-System
This project visualizes tennis match data by tracking player and ball movements on a scaled-down mini-court. Using computer vision (OpenCV), it maps real-world positions to a 2D court, providing real-time updates on player positioning, ball trajectories, and key interactions for match analysis and strategy planning.
